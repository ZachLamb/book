# Report

As a class, we brainstormed and came up with a long list of further questions we can ask based
on the "self-introduction" data. Out of these questions, our team chose to tackle on
the following:

# (What are the different majors?)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# (Any common first names?)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# (Who's the most unique person?)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}

# (Who has the longest name?)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}
