# Method

The main question is too general and too vague. As a class, we brainstormed
and came up with a list of specific questions that are easier to tackle while useful
for making the decision.

From the class discussion, we wrote down five specific questions that are particularly interesting.

* How big is the community behind the framekwork?
* How many packages/libraries are available?
* Is there big cross-platform support?
* How easy is it to learn?
* How popular is it?

From the above list, my team chose a question, worked on it, and created a report on the next page.
